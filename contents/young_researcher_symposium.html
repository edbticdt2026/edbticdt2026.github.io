<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Young Researcher Symposium at EDBT 2026</h2>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <b>young researcher symposium at EDBT 2026</b> aims to replace the traditional <b>PhD Workshop</b>, shifting from the conventional paper-presentation format toward a more engaging, interactive, and community-driven experience. Recognizing that the value of a PhD workshop extends beyond presenting research, the new format is designed to foster <b>active participation</b>, <b>peer-to-peer connections</b>, and <b>mentorship opportunities</b> that support students’ long-term academic and professional growth.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Instead of focusing solely on research talks, the workshop will include a <b>diverse set of activities</b> that encourage meaningful engagement and knowledge exchange. These include <b>invited talks</b> by distinguished scholars offering insights into emerging research directions and professional development; a <b>panel discussion</b> featuring experts from academia and industry sharing practical advice on navigating career opportunities and perform job search in both academia and industry; <b>structured networking sessions</b> that provide opportunities for students to interact with peers, mentors, and senior researchers; and a <b>personalized mentoring program</b> that connects students with mentors based on their research interests and goals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through these activities, the workshop aims to cultivate a <b>supportive and inclusive environment</b> where PhD students can exchange ideas, receive constructive feedback, explore collaborations, and gain guidance on both research and career development. Ultimately, the redesigned EDBT 2026 PhD Workshop seeks to strengthen the sense of community within the data management field and empower the next generation of researchers to engage confidently and creatively with the challenges ahead.
</p>

<p>
	There will be <b>no separate call for participation</b>. Instead, interested participants should indicate their interest in the <b>conference registration form</b> by selecting the corresponding option. Based on this information, the organizers will follow up with further details (including how to join the mentoring (networking) and lightning talk sessions) and may prioritize participation if capacity is limited.

    <h3><b>"Data Processing in Space"</b></h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Satellites have become more widely available thanks to the reduction in the size and cost of their components. As a result, there has been an advent of smaller organizations having the ability to deploy satellites with a variety of data-intensive applications to run on them. One popular application is image analysis to detect, for example, land, ice, clouds, etc. for Earth observation. However, the resource-constrained nature of the devices deployed in satellites creates additional challenges for this resource-intensive application. This talk will discuss the challenges and present lessons learned from our efforts building an Image Processing Unit for a small satellite. Then, it will identify the open research directions to get more value out of data closer to the data sources, i.e., at the edge, for emerging data-intensive applications.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Pınar Tözün</b></i> is an Associate Professor and the Head of Data, Systems, and Robotics Section at IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). Before ITU, she was a research staff member at IBM Almaden Research Center. Prior to joining IBM, she received her PhD from EPFL. Her thesis received ACM SIGMOD Jim Gray Doctoral Dissertation Award Honorable Mention in 2016. Her research focuses on resource-aware machine learning, performance characterization of data-intensive systems, and scalability and efficiency of data-intensive systems on modern hardware.</p>

    <h3><b>"An industry perspective on modern data management challenges"</b></h3>
    <h4>by 
    <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderb42/" target="_blank">Alexander Böhm</a></b></h4>
    <b>SAP SE</b><br>
    <br> 
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: In the database community, there is a very active exchange of concepts and ideas between academia and industry. Frequently, industry systems are created from novel academic ideas, and emerging industry challenges lead to new approaches put forward by the research community. Still, arguably, there are multiple aspects and desirable characteristics of modern data management systems that are highly relevant for system builders in the industry, but don’t receive prominent attention by the research community, yet.

		In this keynote, we will give an industry perspective on these challenges. This includes the importance of native multi-tenancy support, latency challenges in cloud-based system deployments, total cost of ownership (TCO) concerns, security, and the overall challenge of system complexity.

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Alexander Böhm</b></i> is a Distinguished Engineer at SAP and one of the chief architects for the SAP HANA Cloud database management system. His specific focus is on system performance and core database topics. He drives strategic, tactical, and operational projects, including design and architectural changes of the database kernel for key stakeholders, i.e. SAP S/4HANA. Additionally, he is overseeing the evolution of the HANA core database management system with respect to novel hardware and technology as well as cloud-based system deployments.
		Before re-joining SAP in 2024, Alexander was a Principal Engineer at Google Cloud and an Uber-Techlead for Google's AlloyDB for PostgreSQL system.</p>
