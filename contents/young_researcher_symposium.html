<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Young Researcher Symposium at EDBT 2026</h2>


<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <b>young researcher symposium at EDBT 2026</b> aims to replace the traditional <b>PhD Workshop</b>, shifting from the conventional paper-presentation format toward a more engaging, interactive, and community-driven experience. Recognizing that the value of a PhD workshop extends beyond presenting research, the new format is designed to foster <b>active participation</b>, <b>peer-to-peer connections</b>, and <b>mentorship opportunities</b> that support students’ long-term academic and professional growth.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Instead of focusing solely on research talks, the workshop will include a <b>diverse set of activities</b> that encourage meaningful engagement and knowledge exchange. These include <b>invited talks</b> by distinguished scholars offering insights into emerging research directions and professional development; a <b>panel discussion</b> featuring experts from academia and industry sharing practical advice on navigating career opportunities and perform job search in both academia and industry; <b>structured networking sessions</b> that provide opportunities for students to interact with peers, mentors, and senior researchers; and a <b>personalized mentoring program</b> that connects students with mentors based on their research interests and goals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through these activities, the workshop aims to cultivate a <b>supportive and inclusive environment</b> where PhD students can exchange ideas, receive constructive feedback, explore collaborations, and gain guidance on both research and career development. Ultimately, the redesigned EDBT 2026 PhD Workshop seeks to strengthen the sense of community within the data management field and empower the next generation of researchers to engage confidently and creatively with the challenges ahead.

		<h4>by <b><a>Paolo Papotti</a></b></h4>
		<b>EURECOM</b>, France
		<br>
		<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: A PhD in data management can lead to a number of different careers. 
			There are examples of DB researches thriving in research labs, professors with amazing groups, and even CTOs leading start ups including one of the biggest social networks. 
			Still, identifying the 'ideal' career path during postgraduate studies is a formidable challenge, also due to numerous influential factors, such as geographical location and the nature (public or private) of the institutions in question. 
			In this talk, drawing upon my diverse experiences across three continents and in various roles, I will share some stories about my journey to shed some light on these dynamics. 
			While there is no universal blueprint for decision-making, this presentation aims to equip participants with an understanding of the career landscape and what it entails when transitioning into their first post-PhD role.</p>

He has authored more than 150 publications, and his work has been recognized with two “Best of the Conference” citations (SIGMOD 2009, VLDB 2016), three best demo awards (SIGMOD 2015, DBA 2020, SIGMOD 2022), and two Google Faculty Research Awards (2016, 2020).

<h3><b>Keynote:  How-to-PhD - A Dummies Guide towards Research</b><br>by Boris Glavic</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Perhaps you just started your Ph.D. and are still trying to navigate the world of academia and find your thesis topic or you are a seasoned Ph.D. student about to gradate who wants feedback on your body of work. No matter where you are in your journey, it is easy to get stuck in the day-to-day life as a researcher, become a cog in the machine of academia and its publish-or-perish paradigm, and wander off the righteous path. Worry not! In this talk, we are going to take a step back and start from the fundamental question of "What is (CS) research?" and based on the answer to this question reflect on how we should go about the daily activities of a scientist such as literature research, selecting an interesting research problem to work on, experimental evaluation of hypotheses, formalization and theoretical analysis of a problem and solution, systems building, and communicating research ideas and findings (in written form of a publication or in form a presentation).
