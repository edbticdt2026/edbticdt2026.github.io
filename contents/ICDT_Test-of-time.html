    <b>Declarative Probabilistic Programming with Datalog.</b><br/>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The paper proposes Generative Datalog, a probabilistic extension of Datalog that allows sampling from discrete probability distributions. Generative Datalog can be seen as a declarative probabilistic programming language that operates on standard relational databases. The idea is simple but elegant: Given that we can view an existential Datalog program as a generator of families of models, why not turn it into a generator of a probabilistic model? On the side of language design, essentially all it takes is to attach probability distributions to the tuple-generating dependencies. The easy concept of the language is paired with a surprisingly deep mathematical background: Even though all distributions discussed in this initial paper are discrete, laying the semantic groundwork already requires excursions into measure theory. The paper explains the language, defines the semantics, a probabilistic version of the chase, discusses adding constraints in the spirit of probabilistic programming, and touches upon the equivalence problem for programs. It generated a significant amount of follow-up in a variety of top venues spanning database theory, database systems, and programming languages.
