<p><b>Panel abstract</b>: From the birth of the relational model there has been a strong and productive collaboration between the theoretical and systems study of data management.  With the recent 50th anniversary of Codd’s seminal CACM paper, this is a good opportunity to highlight successes and opportunities for continued collaboration across foundations and systems. Given the impact of AI and ML on the field, this is a particularly critical moment to have a cross-community discussion about the future of data management research.  This panel serves to highlight how theoretical and systems study of data management have collaborated successfully in the past, present perspectives on AI and ML in data management research, and reflect on what challenges and opportunities AI and ML bring to continuing the synergy between the ICDT and EDBT communities in the future. This will be a moderated discussion including audience participation.</p>
