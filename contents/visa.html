<p>The Tampere University does not issue formal invitation letters for visas. Tampere University is able to provide visa support letters to attendees as well as authors with accepted papers, demos, tutorials or members of the conference committee.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the person who requests for an invitation letter must pay the participation fee first, and the letter can only be sent after the payment has been made. This is a precaution to prevent any misuse from people who might have underlying purposes for travelling. </p>

<p>Please send your request for a letter in support of a visa application to <a href="mailto:congress@tuni.fi">congress@tuni.fi</a> and include the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Name (as it appears on the passport) of the conference attendee and mailing address</li>
	<li>Authors and/or speakers should indicate their paper title, or title of their talk</li>
	<li>An email address of where letter can be sent</li>
</ul>

<p>Those requesting a letter should allow 5-7 business days to receive it. All requests are handled in the order they are received.</p>
