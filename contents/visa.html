<p>The Tampere University does not issue formal invitation letters for visas. Tampere University is able to provide visa support letters to attendees as well as authors with accepted papers, demos, tutorials or members of the conference committee.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the person who requests for an invitation letter must register and pay the participation fee first, and the letter can only be sent after the registration and payment has been made. There is a question about invitation letters to the registration form. This is a precaution to prevent any misuse from people who might have underlying purposes for travelling.</p>

<p>Those requesting a letter should allow 5-7 business days to receive it. All requests are handled in the order they are received.</p>
