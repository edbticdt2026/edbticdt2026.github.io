    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Florent Capelli</b></i> is a junior professor at CRIL of Université d'Artois in Lens. His research focuses on the study of aggregation problems, from enumeration to counting problems where one aims to understanding a large set of solutions without necessarely exploring it completely. He is particularly interested in problems from database theory, proof complexity and optimization. His favorite algorithmic techniques are based on data structures used in the realm of knowledge compilation which uses syntactically restricted circuits to offer trade-offs between size and tractability. He has co-authored two best newcomer papers at ICDT and regularly participates in PC for conferences in theoretical computer sciences, AI and databases. </p>
