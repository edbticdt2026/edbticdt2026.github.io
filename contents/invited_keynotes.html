    <h3><b>"Adaptive database systems: Navigating chaos in a Heterogeneous
        Landscape"</b></h3>
    <h4>by <b><a href="https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki/?lang=en" target="_blank">Anastasia Ailamaki</a></b></h4>
    <b>Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne</b><br>
    <br> 
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Database systems face new hurdles with the rise of diverse
        hardware setups and varying workloads. Evolving hardware, with its mix of different components and changing configurations, complicates how data
        moves within systems, affecting performance. At the same time, the surge in data-centric analytics and powerful AI
        models brings a wide range of workloads that systems must handle. The old way of designing systems based on predicted performance doesn't work well
        anymore, leading to inefficiencies. This talk dives into the complexities of modern hardware and diverse workloads in database systems. It highlights the limitations of standard
        approaches. It stresses the need for systems that can adapt without relying on fixed assumptions about hardware or workloads. Our goal is to
        create resilient and efficient database systems ready for heterogeneity and real-time evolution.</p>

    <b>Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble</b><br>
    <br>    
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: The last few years has seen a proliferation of digital work and education platforms from crowdsourcing and freelancing marketplaces to MOOC-type platforms. 
        Educational technologies coupled with AI hold the promise of helping learners better upskill but like in any other societally critical AI-powered system, the question of ethics arises. 
        I will describe my perspective on rethinking the design of AIED by combining the power of data management and machine learning to better implement education theories and provide safe data-informed personalized upskilling.</p>

    <h3><b>"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Data and AI"</b></h3>
    <h4>by <b><a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/" target="_blank">H.V. Jagadish</a></b></h4>
    <b>Michigan Institute for Data Science</b><br>
    <br>    
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) has become a hot button issue today.  For the past few years, there have been numerous efforts to raise awareness and to do better in hiring faculty, in training students and in running conferences.  
        There has been enough success, at least in some places, that the blow back has started.  In this talk, I will discuss DEI in the context of data science and AI, and draw parallels with DEI in broader society.  Specifically, I will talk about diversity in data types, equity for data subjects, and inclusion of data users as DEI for data.</p>

    <h3><b>"Natural Language Data Interfaces: A Data Access Odyssey"</b></h3>
    <h4>by <b><a href="http://web.imsi.athenarc.gr/~georgia/" target="_blank">Georgia Koutrika</a></b></h4>
    <b>Athena Research Center</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Back in 1970's, E. F. Codd worked on a prototype of a natural language question and answer application that would sit on top of a relational database system. 
        Soon, natural language interfaces for databases (NLIDBs) became the holy grail for the database community. 
        Different approaches have been proposed from the database, machine learning and NLP communities. Interest in the topic has had its peaks and valleys. 
        After a long and adventurous journey of almost 50 years, there is a rekindled interest in NLIDBs in recent years, fueled by the need for democratizing data access and by the recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing, in particular. 
        Neural NLIDBs are popping up like mushrooms. Are we close to finding the holy grail of data access? In this talk, we will go over the landscape of NLIDBs covering important research milestones to the latest neural-based developments in the field. 
        We will present the lurking challenges that we need to surpass and the exciting research opportunities that the database community is called to solve.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Georgia Koutrika</b></i> is a Research Director at Athena Research Center in Greece. Before that, she worked at HP Labs, and IBM Almaden. 
        She was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, and she earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, in Greece. 
        Her research emerges at the intersection of data management and deep learning, focusing on conversational data exploration, fairness, and learnt data management. 
        Her work has been incorporated in commercial products, described in 19 granted patents and 26 patent applications in the US and worldwide, and published in top-tier conferences and journals.
        She is a member of the VLDB Endowment Board of Trustees, coordinating EiC for VLDB Journal, and chair of the ACM Europe Working Group on Seasonal Schools. 
        She is EDBT2025 Demo Chair, and she was PC co-chair for VLDB 2023, co-EiC of Proceedings of the VLDB (PVLDB) Vol 16, general chair for ACM SIGMOD 2016, and member of the PVLDB Advisory board.  
        She has received the EDBT 2023 Test-of-Time award, 2 best demo awards, and several industrial recognitions.

    <h3><b>"How Database Theory Helps Teach Relational Queries in Database Education"</b></h3>
    <h4>by <b><a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/" target="_blank">Sudeepa Roy</a></b></h4>
    <b>Duke University</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Data analytics skills have become an indispensable part of any education
        that seeks to prepare its students for the modern workforce. Essential in this skill set is the ability to work with structured relational
        data. Relational queries are based on logic and may be declarative in nature, posing new challenges to novices and students. Manual teaching
        resources being limited and enrollment growing rapidly, automated tools that help students debug queries and explain errors are potential
        game-changers in database education. We present a suite of tools built on the foundations of database theory that has been used by over 1600
        students in database classes at Duke University, showcasing a high-impact application of database theory in database education.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Sudeepa Roy</b></i> is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Duke
        University. She works broadly in data management, with a focus on the foundational aspects of big data analysis, which includes causal
        inference and explanations for big data, debugging queries, data repair, data provenance, and probabilistic databases. Before joining Duke in
        2015, she did a postdoc at the University of Washington, and obtained her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania when she received a Google
        Ph.D. fellowship in structured data. She co-directs the Almost Matching Exactly lab for interpretable causal inference at Duke University, is a
        recipient of an NSF CAREER Award and a VLDB Early Career Research Contributions Award, and will serve as the Program Committee Chair of
        the International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT) 2025.
