City hospitality in Tampere begins with an official reception at the Old City Hall! The stunning Neo-Renaissance-style Tampere City Hall is located on the Central Square and was designed by architect Georg Schreck and completed in 1890. Over the years, the building has played a significant role in the city’s history, serving as a center of administration and hosting many important events, including those during the General Strike of 1905 and the Finnish Civil War. Renovated twice, the Old City Hall now functions as a venue for official celebrations and receptions.
