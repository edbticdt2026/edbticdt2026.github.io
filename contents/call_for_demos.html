<p>
The annual International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) is a leading international forum for researchers, developers, and users to present and discuss cutting-edge ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences related to data management.
<p>

<p>
The EDBT demonstration track has become an important venue for sharing prototype systems with the broader data management community. We solicit original demonstration proposals that will showcase the most exciting new data management technologies.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Important Dates</h3></b>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><s>December 3, 2025</s> <b>December 10, 2025</b> at midnight CET (3PM PST): Paper submission</li>
        <li><s>January 21, 2026</s> <b>January 26, 2026</b>: Notification of accept/reject</li>
        <li><s>February 4, 2026</s> <b>February 6, 2026</b>: Camera-Ready copy</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Topics of interest</h3></b>
<p>
We welcome demo papers on all EDBT topics as specified in the EDBT <a target="_blank" href="?contents=EDBT_CFP.html">call for research papers</a>. Demonstrations may consist of software, hardware, or both. We encourage submissions related to all aspects of data management and particularly work on topics of emerging interest in the database research and development communities. The emphasis of the EDBT demonstration program is on visionary, next-generation systems requiring significant research and development effort.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Evaluation Criteria</h3></b>
<p>
Selection of demonstrations for presentation at EDBT is highly competitive. The evaluation criteria include both the audience experience and the novelty of the system. The proposal should include a description of the novel intellectual content of the underlying system and of its architecture. The demonstration proposal must include citations of the most relevant papers about the proposed system and any previous publications of that same system.
</p>

<p>
The proposal should also describe in detail what EDBT attendees who view the demonstration will experience. What exactly will the audience see? Will they be able to interact with the system? Is there an interesting scenario or script that the demonstrators will use to motivate the demonstration?
</p>

<p>
Finally, authors are highly encouraged to include a short video (up to 5 minutes) of their demonstration to illustrate the user experience and the demo scenario. Although the inclusion of the video is not mandatory, its existence provides a better view of the proposed system and highly increases the chances of acceptance.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
The EDBT 2026 demo track follows the same COI policies as the research track as explained in
the EDBT <a target="_blank" href="?contents=EDBT_CFP.html">call for research papers</a>.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate submissions</h3></b>
<p>
A demo paper submitted to EDBT 2026 must not be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after authors submit their work to EDBT, they must await the response from EDBT and only resubmit elsewhere if their paper is rejected (or withdrawn at their request) from EDBT.
</p>





<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission guidelines</h3></b>
<p>
Length: Demo papers (including bibliographic references) should not exceed 4 pages.
</p>

<p>
File type: Each paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default configurations.
</p>

<p>
Papers should be formatted according to the latest ACM Proceedings Format without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, etc. EDBT uses non-anonymous submissions, which means that the authors must list their names and affiliations as part of their submission. Reviewers, on the other hand, are anonymous to the authors. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected. Detailed instructions and templates can be found in the EDBT <a target="_blank" href="?contents=EDBT_CFP.html">call for research papers</a>.
