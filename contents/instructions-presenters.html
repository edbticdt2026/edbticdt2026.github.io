<p>In this section, presenters will find all the necessary information to conduct their presentations.
</p>


<h2>Research Papers</h2>

<p><b>Before the Presentation - Providing the Materials</b></p>

<p>To ensure the smooth flow of the sessions, we kindly ask all presenters to <b>provide the materials</b> they will use during their presentations (mainly the set of slides) before their session begins. These will be stored in <b>local machines</b> to prevent the need to connect and configure personal laptops during the sessions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To facilitate this process, we request that presenters arrive least <b>10 minutes earlier</b> to the designated room where the event is being held. A volunteer (wearing a Tampere University shirt) will be there to gather the materials.</li>
	<li>The <b>room assigned</b> to each session can be found in the program overview and in the detailed program. Be sure to head to the room ahead of time!</li>
	<li>Please provide all presentation materials on a <b>USB flash drive</b> in <b>PDF</b> and/or <b>PPT(X)</b> format. Since the local machines have Microsoft PowerPoint installed, PPT(X) files should work without issue. However, PDF is the preferred format to ensure compatibility, so please bring a PDF copy as a backup to avoid any last-minute technical difficulties.</li>
	<li>If you forget your USB drive or encounter technical issues, we will provide a <b>Google Drive link</b> for uploading the materials. However, this link is intended for <b>emergency use only</b> and will be provided exclusively during the preparation period before the session begins. Please note that using a USB drive remains the preferred option.</li>
	<li>Naturally, a test can be done before the session starts to check that everything works.</li>
	<li>We ask any other material (e.g. notebooks for the tutorials) to also be delivered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation in making the event run efficiently!</p>

<h2>EDBT Demo Session</h2>

<p>The EDBT Demo sessions will be held in Café & Aula Toivo:<br/>
Demo Session 1: March 25th, from 11:00 - 12:30<br/>
Demo Session 2: March 26th, from 11:00 - 12:30</p>

<p>To guarantee a smooth preparation, we ask the participants to arrive 20 minutes early in order to set everything up.</p>

<p>There are not specific places assigned to each participant, so once you get to the room you can set up the demo wherever you like. A0 boards will be available for all presenters to hang posters. Each demo will be provided with a table, and access to an electricity outlet to plug laptops. In Finland plug types F and C are used, so be sure to check whether you need an adapter. We are currently in the process of organizing external monitors, but we may not be able to offer a monitor to every participant.</p>
