<p>
    We solicit proposals for tutorials for presentation at the <a target="_blank" href="https://edbticdt2026.github.io/">EDBT Conference</a> to be held in Tampere, Finland. Proposals must provide an in-depth survey of the selected topic, with the option of describing specific works in depth. Proposals should include a meaningful summary of open issues in the area. The topic of the tutorial should be broad enough to attract a significant audience and must include enough details to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Guidelines</h3></b>
<p>
    Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, as a single PDF file to the Tutorial Chairs, Sihem Amer-Yahia &#60;<a href="mailto:Sihem.Amer-Yahia@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr">Sihem.Amer-Yahia@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr</a>&#62; and Timos Sellis &#60;<a href="mailto:timos@athenarc.gr">timos@athenarc.gr</a>&#62;.  The submission should not be more than 4 (four) pages long and papers should be formatted according to the EDBT 2026 guidelines, which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://edbticdt2026.github.io/?contents=EDBT_CFP.html">here</a>. The conference is single-blind, which means that the authors should include their names and affiliations. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected. We suggest the following content in your tutorial proposal:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Preferred duration (1.5 or 3 hours; if the tutorial can be of either length, please be sure to identify which material in each case)</li>
    <li>Abstract</li>
    <li>Outline presenting the scope and depth of the coverage of the topics to be addressed by the tutorial. Please associate the different parts with the name of the presenter.</li>
    <li>Goals and objectives</li>
    <li>Intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge the audience must have</li>
    <li>Biography (no longer than a few sentences) of the speakers, including contact information. We expect at least one senior presenter to be included. Please also indicate the approximate length of time each presenter will be speaking.</li>
    <li>If an earlier version of the tutorial has been presented in a different venue, indicate those venues as well as the difference in the content with the other editions of the tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note the following requirements for the tutorial program.
</p>
<p>
Tutorials that bridge the gap between database research and other disciplines, and those showing the relevance of database technology in those disciplines are of particular interest.
</p>
<p>
Selected tutorials will be archived as articles in the conference proceedings. An article (4 pages) will be requested from the authors. It is expected to be different from the tutorial proposal. It should focus on providing an introduction to the presented topic, highlighting the main related work, summarizing the content of the tutorial, and be educational in nature. Details on the formatting of the tutorial articles will be provided to the authors of tutorials selected for presentation at EDBT 2026 at a later date.
